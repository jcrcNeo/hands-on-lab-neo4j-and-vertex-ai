# Lab 6 - Graph Data Science
In this lab, we're going to work with another notebook.  We're going to generate a graph embedding using Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS).  This will be an additional feature we can use to train our machine learning model later.

So, let's get started!  Open up the [embedding.ipynb](embedding.ipynb) notebook in Vertex AI Workbench.  Then run through it.
