# Lab 7 - Vertex AI AutoML
Now we've reached what we've been working toward -- pulling graph data into Vertex AI.  We're going to work with two notebooks in this lab.

## Raw Data
First, we're going to work with the raw data set.  We'll do the following:
* Pull it from a bucket
* Break into train, test and validation sets
* Train a classifier

To do that, open the [vertex_ai_raw.ipynb](vertex_ai_raw.ipynb) in Vertex AI Workbench.

## Data with Embedding
Now, let's build a similar classifier to the last one.  But, this time we're going to use data from our graph embedding.  We can do that by running the [vertex_ai_embedding.ipynb](vertex_ai_embedding.ipynb) in Vertex AI Workbench.
